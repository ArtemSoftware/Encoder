# Cipherstor
ArtemSoftware Project

This project is done by Artem Kalinovskiy. Cipherstor is a multifunctional app used to encrypt and decrypt data. It has got a lot of encryption algorythms.

Encryption Algorythms:
Base64 - QmFzZTY0IGV4YW1wbGU= = "Base64 example"

SHA1 - a4ac7298d778b95f2673d9135f48c0eb8bd313d1 = "SHA-1 example"

SHA1 file - No example, hashes file in SHA-1

MD5 - 95ae138f41186cfab5a1b80bffa366cf = "MD5 example"

MS5 file - No example, just hashes file in MD5

MAC - Written by me, hashes string with key, after, another person can check if this string was rewritten.

CRC32 - 422377282 = "CRC32 example"

CRC32 file - returns CRC32 file hash

Base convert - Just understand that 32(10) = 20(16)

Data Hash - SHA-1 hasher, but it's bug. It have to be a SHA-256 hash

And last - Symmetrical encryption algorythm, 8de236c0808bb92608f06c885c9072b4288:302:331:2828957e59392ec74ceb18b29389e09d5cc = "test" with "test key".
